# REPORT:
## Framing-
ML systems learn how to combine input to produce useful predictions on never-before-seen data.

### 1. Training
Training means creating or learning the model. That is, you show the model labeled examples and enable the model to gradually learn the relationships between features and label.
### 2. Inference
Inference means applying the trained model to unlabeled examples. That is, you use the trained model to make useful predictions.
### Regression VS Classification
Regression based algorithms as used mostly for continuos data sets,where we predicts housing prices and Classification based models basicary work in binary(more or less) that is predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign or an email is spam or not-spam
